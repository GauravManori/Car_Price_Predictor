This project takes the parameters of an used car like: Company name, Model name, Year of Purchase, Fuel Type and Number of Kilometers it has been driven.
It then predicts the possible price of the car. 

# How this project does?
1. First of all the data was scraped from Quikr.com 
2. The data was cleaned and analysed.
3. Then a Linear Regression model was built on top of it which had 0.88 R2_score.

This project was given the form of an website built on Flask where we used the Linear Regression model to perform predictions.
